    Added :meth:`~.Statevector.from_circuit` class method to create a
    statevector from a quantum circuit, mirroring the existing
    :meth:`~.Operator.from_circuit` functionality. This method properly
    handles circuit layouts to ensure consistent results regardless of
    transpilation optimization levels. For example::

      from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
      from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector
      
      qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
      qc.h(0)
      qc.cx(0, 1)
      sv = Statevector.from_circuit(qc)
